## Building for mac

- clone the repository and its submodules

   `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/v7b1/mi-UGens.git`

- cd into the directory of the project you want to build

- mkdir build

- cd build

and then:

- cmake -DSC_PATH="path/to/sc-src" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
- make



or use the included `mac-build.sh` script to build all projects at once. It takes the path to SuperCollider source code as its first argument

```bash
cd mi-UGens
./mac-build.sh PATH/TO/SC/SOURCE/CODE
```

Then step inside the newly created build folder and copy the Mi-UGens folder to your SuperCollider extensions.



For compiled mac versions see https://vboehm.net/downloads



## Building for linux

Clone the repository and its submodules

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/v7b1/mi-UGens.git`

Use the included `linux-build.sh` script to build for linux. It takes the SuperCollider source code as its first argument.

```bash
cd mi-UGens
./linux-build.sh PATH/TO/SC/SOURCE/CODE
```



Collect the UGen files from the build folders of the projects and put them together with the sc folder into your SC extensions folder.
